//! Common types for the Xous Ethereum App.
//!
//! This crate provides shared types used by both the ethapp service
//! and client libraries. All types are designed to be serializable
//! with rkyv for efficient Xous IPC.
//!
//! # Security Note
//!
//! These types cross trust boundaries. All validation must happen
//! in the ethapp service after deserialization.
